As a Senior UI Developer at Lithia Motors Inc. since January 2023, I have specialized in crafting user interfaces using the Angular Framework for single-page application development. My role involves enhancing user experiences by designing innovative web features with Angular and TypeScript, incorporating IBM Carbon Design Components, and integrating functionalities such as drag-and-drop, multi-select, and various charts. I have a strong focus on data binding, dependency injection, and the development of responsive, cross-browser compatible layouts using HTML/CSS/SASS. Additionally, I've created custom directives and filters in TypeScript, developed reusable UI components, and utilized Angular for data representation with HighCharts. My work also extends to using Angular 11 and 14 for component-based architecture and reactive forms, respectively, alongside RXJS for managing asynchronous data. I ensure efficient design and development of user interaction screens, implement security measures like AuthGuards and HTTP interceptors, and contribute to quality assurance and code reviews. My toolkit includes AWS Code Commit, GitHub, and unit testing with Karma, underpinning a commitment to quality and compliance in software development.`,
